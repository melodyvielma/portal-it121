       <p>I am Melody Vielma, I am twenty years old and I am a student at Seattle Central and I'm in the Year Up program. 
          I'm in the Applications Development track where I plan to apply the skills that I learn to land myself a job as a Junior Developer.
          My main goal is to work for a big and ethical company. After I complete the Year Up program, I am going to take the initiative to 
          expand my skills in JavaScript and learn some Python so I can have more advanced knowledge in what I do so I can provide better 
          service to my clients. In high school I was a very applicated student and graduated with a 4.07 GPA and was in the top 5% of 
          my class of a little over 600 students. My ambition always drove me to dedicate many hours to homework and studying time so that 
          I could always be one of the best students in my classes. I faced many obstacles throughout my years in high school, such as 
          constantly moving schools in different states. This should have negatively affected my grades in school and my mental health 
          overall, but I stayed determined and maintained my good grades. I believe this is a skill that can reflect on my professional 
          career as well because I enjoy challenges and they incline me to do my best.</p>

        <p>I have two years of customer service experience at a Mexican ice cream shop. I started working at this job when I moved to Arizona 
          and continued to work there until I moved to Washington. Throughout my time there, I learned to work under pressure in 
          a fast-paced environment and have learned how to keep a calm and positive attitude even when things are stressful. Whenever 
          the store was not busy, I would go out of my way to do things that were not included in the job description such as deep cleaning, 
          ordering and bringing inventory, staying after to refill items for the next shift, etc. I will go out of my way to do things 
          that may not be expected of me, this allows me to be prepared and organized. Organization is a very important thing to me, 
          working in unorganized or messy conditions make me feel like I cannot work efficiently. As a result of this, I always organize 
          all my work and will stop to organize any messy or cluttered spaces (physical or mental).</p>

        <p>I am passionate about finding new things to do/experience, I am not scared to take risks and new environments/circumstances 
          always intrigue me. I am open to and always welcome change. I love being challenged in accomplishing a goal because it makes 
          me feel very proud of myself when I am finally able to complete that objective. Trying new foods, finding new hobbies, 
          and exploring new places are all things that I enjoy doing because I do not like restricting myself to only certain things. 
          Having a wide range of skills and abilities is my main personal and profession goal.</p>
